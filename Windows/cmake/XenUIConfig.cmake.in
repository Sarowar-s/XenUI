# This template generates the XenUIConfig.cmake file. It ensures that any
# project using XenUI will also find all the necessary dependencies like SDL3,
# Freetype, and OpenGL.

# Find all the libraries that XenUI itself depends on. This makes them
# available to any project that uses XenUI. The versions here should
# match the ones used in the main CMakeLists.txt.
find_dependency(OpenGL REQUIRED)
find_dependency(Freetype REQUIRED)

# NOTE: We don't need to find SDL3, SDL3_ttf, or SDL3_image here because
# the main CMakeLists.txt finds them manually and links them directly.
# The necessary library paths are already encoded into the XenUI::XenUI target.
# GLM is also handled automatically as it's a header-only INTERFACE target.

# Check if the main library target has been defined, and if not,
# include the file that defines it.
